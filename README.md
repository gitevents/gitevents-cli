# gitevents-cli

Command line utility to make configuring and setting up  [gitevents](https://github.com/gitevents/gitevents-core) easier.

## Usage:

Until gitevents-cli is ready to be published on NPM (and potentially included in the core), get it running by cloning the repository and issuing `npm link` inside the repository.

After that you should be able to run the command `gitevents` and follow the instructions:

```$ gitevents

  Usage: gitevents [options] [command]


  Commands:

    config   Run interactive configuration generator
    init     Run interactive gitevents initialisation

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
```

## Roadmap:

1. Interactive configuration builder
2. Automated GitHub organisation/repo management
3. ???
